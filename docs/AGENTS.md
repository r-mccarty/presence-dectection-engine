# AGENTS.md – Documentation Directory

Guidelines for agents editing documentation under `docs/`. This directory contains comprehensive technical and operational documentation. **Always consult `../CLAUDE.md` first** – it serves as the primary context map and references the most critical docs below.

## Current Status
- **Phase 3 is DEPLOYED** and fully operational
- Documentation reflects production system with 4-state debounced presence detection, distance windowing, and MAD calibration services

## Document Topology

## Authoring Principles
1. **Accuracy first** – reflect actual firmware defaults and current state:
   - **Baseline**: μ_still = 6.7%, σ_still = 3.5% (calibrated 2025-11-06)
   - **Thresholds**: k_on = 9.0, k_off = 4.0
   - **Debounce timers**: on = 3s, off = 5s, absolute_clear = 30s
   - **Distance window**: d_min = 0 cm, d_max = 600 cm (tunable)
   - **Phase 3 is DEPLOYED** (document calibration + distance window behavior)
2. **Phase markers** – clearly distinguish:
   - ✅ Phase 1 (Z-score detection) – COMPLETE
   - ✅ Phase 2 (State machine + debouncing) – DEPLOYED
   - ✅ Phase 3 (Automated calibration + hardening) – DEPLOYED (wizard + helpers live)
3. **Audience clarity**:
   - Engineering specs (ARCHITECTURE.md, presence-engine-spec.md) assume C++/ESPHome expertise
   - Operator guides (quickstart.md, troubleshooting.md, FAQ) must be accessible to Home Assistant users
   - Workflow docs (DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md, HARDWARE_SETUP.md) bridge both audiences
4. **Update everything** – when behavior changes, update all affected docs:
   - Technical specs (ARCHITECTURE.md, presence-engine-spec.md)
   - User guides (quickstart.md, troubleshooting.md, FAQ)
   - Configuration examples (ESPHome YAML, HA dashboards)
   - Root docs (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
   - Tests (unit tests, E2E tests)
5. **Reference CLAUDE.md structure** – when creating cross-references, prioritize the 5 primary docs that CLAUDE.md highlights

## Style Guide
- Markdown, 2-space indentation inside lists and code fences, ≤120 character lines.
- Use fenced code blocks with language hints (` ```yaml`, ` ```cpp`, ` ```bash`).
- Prefer active voice and present tense.
- Call out warnings with blockquotes: `> **Warning**: ...`
- Link to related sections using relative paths (`[Phase 2 checklist](phase2-completion-steps.md)`).
- Embed images from `assets/` with descriptive alt text.

## Critical Context: Two-Machine Workflow

This project uses a **two-machine workflow** (detailed in DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md):
- **Codespaces/Local**: Documentation editing, git operations
- **ubuntu-node**: Firmware compilation, flashing, Home Assistant API access

When documenting workflows:
- Clearly indicate which machine each step runs on
- Provide SSH instructions when steps require ubuntu-node
- Explain why certain operations require physical hardware access
- Reference helper scripts on ubuntu-node (`~/sync-and-flash.sh`, `~/flash-firmware.sh`)

## Review Checklist Before Commit
- [ ] Facts match firmware + HA configuration (entity IDs, defaults, state names)
- [ ] Phase status correct (Phase 3 DEPLOYED, wizard + helpers documented)
- [ ] Two-machine workflow clearly explained where relevant
- [ ] Screenshots/diagrams updated if UI changed
- [ ] Internal/external links work (use `markdown-link-check` if unsure)
- [ ] Spelling/grammar checked (`cspell` or editor tools)
- [ ] Phase references accurate (✅ Phase 1/2/3 complete, next up: persistence/analytics)
- [ ] Tables + lists render correctly in GitHub preview
- [ ] Cross-references prioritize the 5 primary docs from CLAUDE.md

## Helpful Commands
```bash
# Lint Markdown (install markdownlint-cli first)
markdownlint docs/**/*.md

# Spell check (install cspell first)
cspell "docs/**/*.md"

# Search for outdated values
rg "k_on" docs/
rg "Phase 1" docs/
```
